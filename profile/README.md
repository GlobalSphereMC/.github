# GlobalSphere - Minecraft  

## About Us  
GlobalSphere is a geopolitical themed Minecraft server that uses a map of Asia and the surrounding regions as its map.  
Although the server is small, the community is strongly united and we have had many fun experiences with each other going back past the spring of 2022.  
The server does not intend to reset and has only reset twice - once because of community demand and death (due to poor decisions because of this being our first server ownership experience), and the second time because of issues with the server host.   
The server has custom features like limited access to diamond armor and weapons, a new "steel" tier past iron, a custom warp system, the [brewery](https://github.com/DieReicheErethons/Brewery) plugin replacing potions, and more!  

## This Organization  
This organization stores some public and private repositories.  

Public:  
- Our website!  
- Pieces of our intellectual property (namely code, json files, and art) that we wish to share with the public.  
  - Although the SpigotModding library was originally designed for use in GlobalSphere, it has now spread to other servers and is therefore not located in this organization.
    - The SpigotModding repository can be found [here.](https://github.com/MythicalFlame/SpigotModding)  

Private:  
- Pieces of our intellectual property that we do not wish to share with the public.  
  - We may choose to release our property (or a version of it) at any time under an open-source license.
